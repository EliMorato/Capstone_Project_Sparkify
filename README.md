# Sparkify Capstone Project

## Libraries
For this project the necessary libraries used are:
 - Pyspark
 - Plotly
 
## Motivation
In this project we work with a music application data called Sparkify and our main goal is to predict whether a user is going to cancel it's subscription or not.

As one can imagine, there is a lot of data registering all the movements a user does while using the application, so this is the principal problem.

## Files
This Project includes just one file: 
 - Sparkify.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing all the code needed to develop each one of the steps to reach the objective of the project.

# Results

![Alt text](newplot.png?raw=true "Actions per session")

The result of the analysis is a model reaching about 86% accuracy when predicting if a user is going to cancel it's subscription.
